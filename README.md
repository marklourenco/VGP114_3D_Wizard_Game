# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è VGP114 Wizard Game  
*A 3D Platformer Adventure built in Unreal Engine*

Welcome to our **Wizard Game**, a student project developed for our Software Development class. The goal was to explore Unreal Engine Blueprints while building a game collaboratively in a team of three‚Äîunder tight deadlines.

The result? A 3D wizard-themed platformer where the player journeys through mystical castle levels, solving puzzles and unlocking magical abilities to ultimately escape.

## üìö What We Learned

- **Unreal Engine Blueprinting**  
  Learned core game logic implementation with Blueprints.

- **UI/UX Design**  
  Created and integrated interactive menus and HUD elements.

- **Level Design**  
  Designed and iterated on platforming challenges and enemy placement.

- **3D Modeling & Animation**  
  Built characters and props using Maya and brought them to life with animation blueprints.

- **Texturing & Lighting**  
  Applied stylized materials and experimented with lighting for atmosphere.

## üöÄ Future Improvements

While we're proud of what we accomplished, there‚Äôs always room to level up:

- **Lighting Polish**  
  Fine-tune lighting across levels for better readability and mood.

- **Improved Game Flow**  
  Streamline player onboarding and ramp up difficulty more naturally.

- **Stretch Goals**  
  - Additional magic abilities  
  - Dialogue/cutscene system  
  - More expansive level design
